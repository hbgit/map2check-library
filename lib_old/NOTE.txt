Adding a new function to the map2check library

1) The function name with its args should be added using a LLVM PASS
	see TrackBasicBlockPass.cpp and TrackBasicBlockPass.hpp in modules/backend/pass/
	
2) Create the files to run the function in the execution time
	see TrackBBLog.c and TrackBBLog.h, as well as, added the file to CMakeLists here
	
3) If the new function to be added needs track data from code, you should use 
	the Container struct:
	3.1) Create a type using Map2CheckTypes.h and a Container Type in "enum Container_Type {"
	3.2) Update Container.c according to the code
	3.3) Update Map2CheckFunctions.c and Map2CheckFunctions.h to track the data from code
	3.4) Update the function void Caller::linkLLVM() in modules/frontend/caller.cpp to add the new function



>> TODO:
	- Updating: Container.h; ContainerRealloc.c; NonDetLog.c; and NonDetLog.h
	- Focus on C++ and template and STL
